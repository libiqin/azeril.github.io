Given an input word and list of English words, determine if the word is anagram with word(s) from the list.

Solution:

Definition: Two words w1 and w2 are anagrams to each other if sort(w1) == sort(w2), in other words, if one could be obtained by finite swaps of letters of the other.

In Swift, given words:[String], we can calculate hashTable:[String : [Int]] so as the keys to be sort( words[i] ) and values be chains of indices into the original words array.

{% highlight swift %}
var hashTable = [String : [Int]]()
       
for i in 0..<words.count {
    let key = sort( words[i] )
    if hashTable[key] != nil {
        hashTable[key]? += [i]
    } else {
        hashTable[key] = [i]
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The lookup operation thus becomes proportional to the length of the input word and choice of the sorting algorithm.

{% highlight swift %}
let key = sort(inputWord)        
for i in hashTable[key]! {
    println("\(words[i])")
}
{% endhighlight %}

Quicksorting in Swift:

{% highlight swift %}
func qsort<T:Comparable>(var items:[T]) -> [T] {
    
    if (items.count <= 1) { return items }
    
    var pivot = items.removeAtIndex(0)
    var lesser:[T] = [], greater:[T] = []
    
    for i in 0...(items.count-1) {
        if (items[i] <= pivot) {
            lesser.append(items[i])
        }
        else {
            greater.append(items[i])
        }
    }
    
    return qsort(lesser) + [pivot] + qsort(greater)
}
{% endhighlight %}
